# Hi there,

# I see you are on my github reps.

# Well you are in bad luck sir, because my domain source isn't to be found here so go away go away.

# hm you're still here?, You must be looking around my junk code and outdated sources?

# ok, look around! **BUT** you know what they say.

# NO CAT SKIDDERS IF YOU WANNA COPY SOME SOURCE SCRIPT, GO FIND YOURSELF A LUA BOOK AND LEARN SOME LUA OFF LUA.ORG! KIDS!
